    <p>Islam is a monotheistic and Abrahamic religion articulated by the Quran (Koran), a religious text considered by its adherents to be the verbatim word of God (Allah), and, for the vast majority of adherents, by the teachings and normative example (called the sunnah, composed of accounts called hadith) of <a href="prophet.html"><strong>Muhammad</strong></a>  (c.570-8 June 632 CE). An adherent of Islam is called a Muslim.Muslims believe that God is one and incomparable and that the purpose of existence is to worship God. Nearly all Muslims consider <a href="prophet.html"><strong>Muhammad</strong></a> to be the last prophet of God.
   <a href="fivepillars.html"><strong>The Five Pillars</strong></a> of Islam are five basic acts in Islam, considered mandatory by believers and are the foundation of Muslim life. They are summarized in the famous hadith of Gabriel.
